- HODL waves, age distribution of coins being moved.
	Metric: Age distribution of coins being moved.
	Why: Long-term holders selling = change in conviction.
	Signal: Long-dormant coins moving → bearish shift.

- Derivatives
	Metric: Perpetual futures funding rate, open interest.
	Why: Overleveraged markets often precede violent corrections.
	Signal: Excessive long OI or high positive funding → sell signal.

- Volume Divergence:
	Metric: Price rising while volume falls.
	Why: Indicates weakening trend.
	Signal: Divergence → impending reversal.

- MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value):
	Why: Gauges if BTC is overvalued relative to holders’ cost basis.
	Signal: High MVRV (>3) → overheated, low MVRV (<1) → undervalued.

- NVT Ratio (Network Value to Transactions)
	Why: "PE ratio" of crypto — high value, low usage = overvalued.
	Signal: Rising NVT with flat usage = bearish.

- Volatility Compression / Expansion (Bollinger Band Squeeze):
	Why: Periods of low volatility often precede large moves.
	Signal: BB width very narrow → prepare for breakout (not directionally biased).

- DXY (US Dollar Index):
	Why: BTC often moves inversely to USD strength.
	Signal: Rising DXY → bearish for BTC; falling DXY → bullish.

- 10-Year Treasury Yield / Inflation Expectations:
	Why: Higher yields = tighter liquidity = bearish for risk assets.
	Signal: Spike in yields → risk-off environment.

- Altcoin/BTC Dominance Shifts:
	Why: BTC dominance dropping rapidly = altcoin euphoria = risk-on.
	Signal: Sharp drop in BTC dominance during uptrend → possible top.
